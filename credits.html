      practice is focused on instrumenting shared experiences and designing Open
      Media Ecologies. In more detail, he approaches music as a vehicle for

      multidisciplinary artist whose practice spans mediums including
      documentary filmmaking, sound installation, sculpture, and music. <br />

      materials, space, and sound. By experimenting with industrial construction
      materials such as concrete, lighting, steel, and electronics, Burelli
      brings to light our convoluted relationship with industry, extractivism,
      production, and consumerism.
