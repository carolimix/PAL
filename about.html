        No one knows everything, everyone knows something, and all knowledge
        resides in humanity… New communications systems should provide community
        members with the means to coordinate their interactions within the same
        virtual universe of knowledge.

        <span>CC0 (Collective Control 0)</span>is a system for live collective
        composition existing in Berlin within HAU2 and also anywhere through the
        portal participativeaudiolab.com
      </p>
      <p>
        It has been designed to enable distributed control to the public through
        physical and digital instruments which directly condition the system’s
        motion, sound, and structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        CC0 was conceived and developed through an open creative process in the
        shape of a hackathon. Three instruments for collective creation were
        conceived: “The Forum, Pendulum, Pulse”.
      </p>
      <p>
        CC0 marks the inauguration of PAL (Participative Audio Lab), a
        initiative aimed at the development of open-source tools to allow
        artists to create and distribute their own participative musical
        experiences. On a broader scale, PAL aims to harvest a culture of open
        creation.

      PAL was initiated thanks to support from the initiative »Prototyping Sonic
      Institutions« organised by Black Swan and CTM Festival 2022. Employing
      decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) infrastructure and thinking,
      Black Swan engaged with a number of resource-pledging silent stakeholders
      to explore new ways of supporting the creation of artistic works.
